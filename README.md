### Introduction

- A couple choice quotes from the book's intro:

> "Because computers are dumb ... programming is fundamentally tedious and frustrating."

> "[Programming] is a wonderful game of puzzle solving and abstract thinking."

> "You are fine -- you just need to keep at it."

> "A program is a building of thought."

> "The best programs are those that manage to do something interesting while still being easy to understand."

> "There are many terrible mistakes to make in program design, and you should go ahead and make them at least once so that you understand them. A sense of what a good program looks like is developer with practice, not learned from a list of rules."

> "There are those who will say _terrible_ things about JavaScript. Many of these things are true."

> "JavaScript is ridiculously liberal in what it allows."

- Trivia: ECMAScript6 was released in 2015
